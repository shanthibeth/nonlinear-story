					<li>Group A of human subjects were given both treatments 5 days ago</li>
					<li>DAY 1 yielded promising results, all subjects could not remember the last 2 weeks but were still able to solve mazes faster than their pre-treatment average.</li>
					<li>However on DAY 3 subjects' mental states began to deteriorate. Their maze times rose steadily, and they became more and more agitated and confused.</li>
					<li>On DAY 4 subjects could no longer remember their families or any other personal connections. When tested in the Color Rooms, they consistently chose the door on the right even when door colors were switched.</li>
					<li>Unable to determine the cause of the deterioration. Future mental states of subjects are unknown.</li>
