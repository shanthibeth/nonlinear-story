				<p><strong>Where am I? What is this place?</strong> <br> Last thing I remember was having dinner with my family... spaghetti I think. It was a school night so I put the kids to bed while Christina cleaned up the kitchen. I kissed them both goodnight, Beth first under her pink princess blanket. She was already hugging that battered stuffed animal she loves. What's its name again? Uhh.. Pinky, no. Maybe Blinky or Inky, something like that... Then Max, he wanted a glass of water, but I told him to stop making excuses and just go to sleep. His sad little eyes followed me to the door, and he gave me a pouty look as I turned off the light... <br>
				Then what? I must have gone back to the kitchen but I can't remember. All I can recall are these blurry images of figures in white above me. Angels? No doctors more likely. Then only cold darkness. Where is my family!!!??!! And what did that thing mean by unpleasant?? I need to get out of here!! <br>
     			Ok don't panic. This room looks like some kind of office. Not very much here just a desk and filing cabinet. I have the weirdest sense of deja vu though. Have I been here before??... Ugh!  Why can't I remember?!? I have the strangest feeling I should go left. But what if they're trying to trick me? Guess I'll look around and then just go with my instincts. I'll leave this here in case I end up here again.</p>

				<h1>Memory serum version 3.14</h1>
				<h2>Changes</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Adjusted the second incubation cycle.</li>
					<li>Increased the duration to 2 hours</li>
					<li>Decreased the initial concentration of beta inhibitors to .2 M</li>
				</ol>
				 <h2>Results</h2>
				 <p>Subjects overall responded more positively to this treatment. All retained basic motor functions, although subjects 5 & 11 suffered from mild tremors that affected their ability to perform tasks requiring fine muscle  control such as typing. However the treatment only seemed to wipe their memories of the last 2 to 6 weeks. All subjects were able to clearly remember their friends and family and were concerned for their wellbeing. Despite this inconvenience no subject was able to remember being taken to this facility or any of the subsequent experiments and were subdued with the standard procedures.</p>
