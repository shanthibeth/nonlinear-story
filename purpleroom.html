				<p>Ugh! All this purple is making my head spin. It feels like I'm surrounded by eggplants, and just the thought of an eggplant has always made me naseous. As if this could get any worse... <br> <br>
				Oh, whenever Max used to feel carsick we would count down from ten, coming up with alliterations 12 days of christmas style. Ok 10 daring dragons, 9 primping ponies, 8 lazing lizards, 7 choking chimps... <br><br>
				Wait chimps, I remember seeing chimps! They were playing with these colored blocks: red, blue, yellow, green, purple, and orange. Each chimp was in the center a pile of blocks arranged in 6 slices like a wheel or pie chart. I think they might have been organizing the blocks somehow?? By color perhaps? The colors started swirling together into an expanding vortex, spinning out of control. Wait that couldn't have been real, could it?... <br>
				<strong>Why can't I remember anything or anyone useful!!</strong>
				</p>

<!-- 				<p>There were 5 no 6, each in a small glass cubicle siting side by side. They were all holding something. Hmm what were they? Apples? No but they were red, some kind of plastic shapes? That's right I can recall them clearly. They were plastic models all about the same size, all red, but they were all different shapes: cubes, spheres, pyramids. Yeah, they were sorting them I think. That's very strnge, why would chimps be sorting their toys? And why all of them in the same way? They couldn't see eachother I don't think, and I don't remember seeing any people. <br><br>
				But how is that possible? There must be someone else here, if not other subjects then at least the researchers running these so called experiments. But as hard as I try I can't seem to remember seeing anyone, just blurry white shapes. At the same time it definitely feels like someone is watching me! Ugh makes me shiver! At least I'm not naseous anymore. <br>
				Ok, since the only way out is forward gotta make a choice: yellow or pink? I guess all the rooms are colors? Is that significant somehow? Must be right?! Or it could be a trick I suppose, who knows with these creepy crazies. Best to see if anything else here points to something useful.

				<h1>Shape Sorting Experiment 9: Stimulant 4.12 with Chimpanzees</h1>
				<p>
					Testing how stimulant effects ability to accurately sort objects based on color. Gave them a pile of primary and secondary colored blocks. Used classical conditioning to train chimps to organize blocks by color. Interestingly without prompting the chimps arranged the blocks in a color wheel around them. Even more surprisingly 60% of the wheels were accurate, with opposing colors across from eachother. <br>
					When the objects were distributed one at a time, at a fixed rate, all chimps were able to accurately sort 70% of them before treatment. After the stimulant was administered their accuracy rose to 85%.</p>

<!-- 				<p>Began by using yellow foam shapes: sphere, cube, tetrahedron, and pyramid. However the chimps mistook the objects for food and tried to eat them. Were not expecting this and had to intervene quickly when chimp 5 began choking. Fortunately no permanent damage was sustained. Also it is interesting to note that when the yellow shapes were visible but outside the glass enclosures the chimps became increasingly agitated until they were fed or the objects were removed from view.<br>
				As an alternative to the yellow models, tried using red plastic objects in the same shapes. This yielded more favorable results. After several days of classical conditioning all chimps were able to accurately sort 75% of the objects by shape. If objects were distributed one at a time at a fixed rate.<br>
				Now that have baseline data, will commence treatment later today of all chimps. Tomorrow will repeat sorting experiments and observe any differences in the chimps' accuracy. Based on rat trials expect an 15-20% decrease in the number of mistakes.</p> -->
