					What's with the monochrome effect? It's a little unsettling. Makes me feel like I'm under some scientist's colored microscope. This must be how lab rats feel and I am not enjoying it! I can sense that someone is watching, makes me twitch. It's hard to think straight... <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Hold on why do lab rats feel significant? Come on think! I have to remember something!! Wait yeah, I do remember lab rats. They were all white in cages covering an entire wall. Shit! There were hundreds of them!<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;
					I should have payed more attention when Beth was protesting animal cruelty last Christmas. She wanted a rescued research rat. Even told the mall Santa! Meanwhile Max went on about a paint set and kept asking Santa why Christmas colors are red and green. He answered the same reason the LA Lakers are purple and yellow, haha smart guy. The way those kids think always surprises me, bet they would have a better chance in here than me! Oh I hope they're alright!!

<!-- 				<p>Hopefully that was the right choice!? Guess I'll just have to keep going and find out. <br>Alright this room looks pretty much identical, except of course the obvious color change. Whats with the monochrome effect? It's a little unsettling. Not like a "oh that's odd" feeling, but more like a "the walls are closing in around me and I'm trapped under a colored microscope of some sick researcher." This must be how lab rats feel and I am not enjoying it. Hold on why do lab rats feel significant? Come on think! I have to remember something!! Wait yeah I do remember lab rats. They were all white in cages covering an entire wall. Shit! There were hundreds of them; 3 or 4 rats to a cage frantically running from one wall into another. They looked so frightened and crazed! Was that here in this facility? If there are that many rats how many human subjects?? <br>
 				I should have payed more attention while Beth was protesting animal cruelty last month. Oh! I miss her so much! What if they have her and Max too?? I can't remember them taking me here, did I really consent to this? I don't think I would, but if they threatned Christina or the kids....<br><br>
 				Breathe, in and out in and out. I can't lose focus. I have to get out if here!!! Imagining the worst won't help me get back to them! I'm sure Christina has it under control she's far smarter than I'll ever beâ€¦ Let's hope they don't know that! <br>
				Breathe! Alright, well i don't have that same sense of deja vu in this room. I don't know if that's good or bad. How do the same things in blue have a completely different feeling?? There must be more significance to the monochrome effect than just the uneasiness it inspires...

				<h1>Mental Stimulant version 3.14</h1>
				<!-- <h2>Summary of results of rat testing</h2> -->
				<ul>
					<li>Extensive rat testing determined that in 75% subjects stimulant had significant decrease in maze time both simple and complex of up to 18% of pre-stimulant times.
					</li>
					<li>20% of subjects experienced no significant change in processing speeds. </li>
					<li>5% were unable to complete any mazes and simply wandered aimlessly or stood frozen at a fork in the path for hours.</li>
				</ul>
				 <!-- <h2>Next Steps</h2> -->
				 <p>Next should establish how this speed enhancing stimulant <strong>Complements</strong> memory serum 2.71. Then will be ready to test on human candidates.</p>
